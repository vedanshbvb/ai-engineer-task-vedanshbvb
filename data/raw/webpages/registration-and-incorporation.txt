* Use this template if the company is being incorporated by a body corporate. If the company has more than one shareholder (that is body corporate), each will have to pass the resolution and provide a register of directors or similar evidence of signing authority (that should not be older than three months). This template must be adjusted to indicate that the body corporate will be one of the shareholders/intends to acquire shares.** Use this template if the company is being incorporated by one or more individuals. If the company has more than one shareholder ( that is an individual), amend this template to include all individuals in one resolution.





                Note
                    


If the company is being incorporated by an individual and body corporate, each will have to pass a separate resolution.
