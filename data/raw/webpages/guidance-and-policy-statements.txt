Guidance, Templates and Policy Statements











ADGM and its three authorities have issued relevant guidance to communicate and explain the principles that underpin the legal framework, which is based on English Common Law.













 
Guidance for applicants

 The guidance for applicants provides information on completing the application to register an entity in ADGM and should be read in conjunction with the relevant legislation. The Guidance Notes do not cover other requirements as set out in the relevant legislation such as contact with the court and other internal obligations that a company will need to consider and carry out.

Supplementary Guidance on Whistleblowing

 In line with global movements favouring transparency, accountability and integrity, ADGM believes a culture that supports speaking up with confidence forms part of any progressive business environment. With that in mind, ADGM has implemented its regulatory framework for whistleblowing (the “Framework”). The Framework includes the WB Regulations; amendments to ER 2019, GEN, MIR and GPM; and this Guidance. This Guidance is issued jointly by the RA under section 3(3) of the WB Regulations and the FSRA under section 15(2) of FSMR. In November 2022, ADGM published its Guiding Principles on Whistleblowing. Those Principles have been incorporated into this Guidance to the extent appropriate, and accordingly the Principles themselves no longer represent current guidance.

In line with global movements favouring transparency, accountability and integrity, ADGM believes a culture that supports speaking up with confidence forms part of any progressive business environment. With that in mind, ADGM has implemented its regulatory framework for whistleblowing (the “Framework”). The Framework includes the WB Regulations; amendments to ER 2019, GEN, MIR and GPM; and this Guidance. This Guidance is issued jointly by the RA under section 3(3) of the WB Regulations and the FSRA under section 15(2) of FSMR. In November 2022, ADGM published its Guiding Principles on Whistleblowing. Those Principles have been incorporated into this Guidance to the extent appropriate, and accordingly the Principles themselves no longer represent current guidance.
